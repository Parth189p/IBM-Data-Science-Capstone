# IBM-Data-Science-Capstone
This is the Final project of course  IBM Data science on coursera.
In this project i used the data from the space X website & useed the webscrapping to scrape the required data from wikipedia.
I used different methods to analysing the data & used SQL for quaring the data.
After getting the approprate data plot the different plots using python.And made a dashboard from the data.
Also built a machine learning model that predict the space shuttle will survive after the landing or not.
